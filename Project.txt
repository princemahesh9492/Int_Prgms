Project Details
================

Previous Company : BirlaSoft (worked 2+ years)

Client           : Synchrony Bank

Project          : BusinessCenter




Recent Project
==============

BusinessCenter is an application developed for Synchrony Bank which provides credits to their 
merchants. This application maintains information of all credits details of merchants. 
This application consists of 2 systems like Business Center and Provider Center.
Here Business Center for business merchants and Provider Center for healthcare merchants. 
Both have the modules like New Application, Accounts, Reports, Manage Users, My Profile.
 

The following credits are offered by this application.

1. Revolving Credit
This type of credit allows borrowers to access a credit limit and make repeated withdrawals as long as they do not exceed the limit. 
The borrower can carry a balance from month to month and make minimum payments or pay off the balance in full.
Examples:
Credit Cards: The most common form of revolving credit. You can make purchases and pay off the balance over time, with interest charged on any balance carried beyond 
the due date.




2. Installment Credit
This type of credit involves borrowing a fixed amount of money and repaying it in equal installments over a set period of time, typically with interest.
Examples:
Mortgages: Loans used to purchase real estate, repaid in regular installments over many years.
Auto Loans: Loans used to purchase a vehicle, repaid in fixed monthly installments.
Personal Loans: Unsecured loans often used for consolidating debt or financing large purchases, repaid in fixed installments.


3.Overdraft Credit
Overdraft credit is a type of credit extension provided by banks that allows a customer to continue making withdrawals or purchases even when their account balance is 
insufficient to cover the transaction. Essentially, it allows you to "overdraw" your checking account, up to a certain limit, without being immediately rejected.

Key Features of Overdraft Credit:
=================================
Limit of Credit: Banks usually set a maximum overdraft limit, which is the maximum amount you can overdraw your account. This limit can vary depending on your
relationship with the bank, account type, and creditworthiness.

Interest & Fees: Overdraft protection is often subject to fees and interest. The fees can be substantial, especially if you don’t pay back the overdraft quickly. 
Fees may include:

Overdraft fee: A flat fee charged every time your account is overdrawn, often between $30-$40 per transaction.
Interest charges: If the overdraft is not paid back quickly, interest charges may apply, sometimes at high rates.
Repayment Terms: Typically, you are required to repay the overdraft within a short period, often within 30 days, to avoid high fees or further penalties.

Types of Overdraft Protection:
==============================
Standard Overdraft Protection: This automatically covers checks, withdrawals, or debit card transactions when your balance is insufficient, up to the pre-arranged limit.
Link to Another Account: Some banks allow you to link your checking account to a savings account or a credit line to cover overdrafts. This can help avoid fees, but may 
involve transfer fees.
Overdraft Line of Credit: Some banks offer a specific line of credit that covers overdrafts. This is different from standard overdraft protection because it is a 
credit product with terms for repayment and interest rates.

How Overdraft Works:
====================
Let’s say you have $50 in your checking account, but you make a purchase for $75. With overdraft protection, the bank may approve the purchase and allow the transaction 
to go through, resulting in a $25 overdraft. You would then owe the bank $75 (the original purchase amount) plus any associated overdraft fees or interest.

Pros and Cons of Overdraft Credit
=================================
Pros:
=====
Convenience: Overdraft credit can prevent you from having transactions declined, especially in emergencies when you need access to funds.
Flexibility: It provides short-term access to funds and can be used to avoid bounced checks or rejected debit card purchases.
Avoids Rejection: Helps maintain a good reputation with merchants and prevents the embarrassment of a declined transaction.

Cons:
=====
High Fees: Overdraft fees can accumulate quickly, leading to expensive charges if the overdraft is not repaid soon after it occurs.
Interest Rates: If the overdraft is covered by a line of credit or a linked credit card, high interest rates may apply.
Risk of Debt: If overdrafts are not managed carefully, it can lead to a cycle of debt with accumulating fees and interest charges.
Overdraft Alternatives:
Linked Accounts: Linking your checking account to a savings account or credit card to cover overdrafts can be a more cost-effective alternative.
Alerts: Setting up account balance alerts can help you stay on top of your balance and avoid overdrawing.
Cash Reserve: Keeping a buffer or minimum balance in your checking account can help avoid the need for overdraft credit.
In short, while overdraft credit can be useful in preventing declined transactions, it’s important to manage it carefully to avoid excessive fees and interest charges.
Always be aware of the terms your bank sets for overdraft protection.


4. Secured Credit
=================
Secured credit involves a loan or credit that is backed by collateral, which the lender can claim if the borrower defaults on the loan.
Examples:
Secured Credit Cards: Often used by individuals with limited or poor credit history. The credit limit is usually equal to a cash deposit made by the borrower.
Home Loans/Auto Loans: Mortgages and auto loans are examples of secured credit where the property or vehicle serves as collateral.


5. Unsecured Credit
===================
Unsecured credit is not backed by collateral. Lenders offer unsecured credit based on the borrower's creditworthiness, such as their credit score and income.
Examples:
Credit Cards: Most credit cards are unsecured, with the borrower having no collateral at stake (other than their credit reputation).
Personal Loans: These are loans granted without any asset backing and depend on the borrower’s financial situation and credit history.


6. Commercial Credit
====================
Definition: Credit extended to businesses rather than individuals. Businesses can use this credit to finance operations, purchase inventory, or expand.
Examples:
Business Credit Cards: Credit cards issued to businesses for managing cash flow.
Business Loans: Loans provided to companies for specific purposes like capital investment or expansion.

==========================

User registration form should be accessible via the "Register" button on the homepage.

1)A user is on the registration page. When: The user enters their details (e.g., name, email, password) and clicks "Submit." Then: The system should validate the fields and show an
 error message if any required field is empty or invalid (e.g., invalid email format, weak password).

2)The user has entered valid information. When: The user clicks "Submit." Then: The system should create a new user account, send a confirmation email, and redirect 
  the user to the "Welcome" page.

3)A user enters an already registered email address. When: The user tries to submit the registration form. Then: The system should show an error message indicating that
  the email is already in use.

4)The registration is successful. When: The user receives a confirmation email. Then: The email should contain a verification link and be sent within 5 minutes of 
  registration.

5)The user has successfully verified their email. When: The user logs in with their credentials. Then: The system should authenticate the user and allow access to the
  dashboard.


Acceptance Criteria:
====================

2. Loan Application Form Validation
===================================
Given: The user is logged into their account and navigates to the loan application page.
When: The user fills out the credit/loan application form and submits it.
Then:

The system should validate that all required fields (e.g., loan amount, income, credit score, loan tenure) are filled out.
The system should display an error message for any incomplete or invalid fields (e.g., "Invalid loan amount", "Please enter a valid income").


2. Credit Eligibility Check
============================
Given: The user has submitted a complete and valid application form.
When: The system processes the loan application.
Then:

The system should perform an eligibility check based on the user's credit score, income, loan amount, and tenure.
If the user does not meet the minimum eligibility criteria (e.g., credit score below a threshold, income not sufficient to cover the loan), the system should reject
 the application and provide a clear reason (e.g., "Your credit score is too low for this loan").
If the user meets the eligibility criteria, proceed to the next step.


3. Interest Rate Calculation
=============================
Given: The user is eligible for the loan.
When: The system processes the loan details.
Then:

The system should calculate the interest rate based on the user's credit score, loan amount, and tenure.
The interest rate should be dynamically adjusted based on the user’s credit score (e.g., lower rates for higher scores).
The system should display the calculated interest rate to the user before finalizing the application.


4. Loan Decision Notification
=============================
Given: The eligibility check and interest rate calculation have been successfully processed.
When: The system makes a decision regarding the loan approval.
Then:

If the loan is approved, the system should display a message such as "Your loan has been approved. You will receive the funds within X business days."
If the loan is rejected, the system should display a message like "Your loan application has been rejected due to [reason] (e.g., insufficient credit score, income, etc.)".
The system should send an email to the user with the loan decision (either approval or rejection) and next steps.


5. Loan Approval and Fund Disbursement
======================================
Given: The loan is approved.
When: The system processes the loan approval and fund disbursement.
Then:

The system should record the loan details in the user's account (e.g., loan amount, tenure, interest rate, and repayment schedule).
The system should send a notification (email/SMS) confirming the loan disbursement and repayment schedule.
The system should initiate the fund transfer to the user’s linked bank account (if applicable).


6. Repayment Schedule Generation
================================
Given: The loan is approved and funds have been disbursed.
When: The system generates the repayment schedule.
Then:

The system should generate a repayment schedule based on the loan amount, interest rate, and tenure (e.g., monthly installments).
The repayment schedule should be accessible to the user from their dashboard or loan details page.
The system should notify the user about upcoming payments at least 2 days in advance via email or SMS.


7. Security and Privacy
=======================
Given: The loan application contains sensitive information (e.g., personal details, financial data).
When: The user submits their application or views their loan status.
Then:

The system should ensure all sensitive data (e.g., credit score, income, loan details) is encrypted during transmission using SSL/TLS protocols..
The user should have the option to view, update, or delete their personal details.

8. Error Handling and Validation
================================
Given: The user has provided incorrect or incomplete information.
When: The system attempts to process the loan application.
Then:

If the user enters invalid information (e.g., a non-numeric value for income or loan amount), the system should display an error message and prevent submission.
If the system encounters an unexpected error (e.g., server failure, database error), it should provide a user-friendly error message and log the error for 
troubleshooting.

9. Loan Tracking and Status
===========================
Given: The user has applied for a loan.
When: The user checks the status of their loan application.
Then:

The system should allow the user to track the status of their loan application (e.g., "In Review", "Approved", "Rejected").
The status should be updated in real-time based on the application process.
The user should be able to view the loan details (amount, tenure, interest rate) and repayment schedule once approved.

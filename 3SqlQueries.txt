1) In Employees_Projects table some rows reference employees who no longer exist in the employees table. Remove these orphaned rows

delete 
from employees_projects 
where employee_id not in (select id 
                          from employees);
========================================================

2) Detect Salary gaps
hint: you want to compare the average salary between departments.



SELECT 
    MAX(Avg_Salary) - MIN(Avg_Salary) AS Salary_Gap
FROM (
    SELECT AVG(Salary) AS Avg_Salary
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY department_id
    ) AS DepartmentAverages;

(or)

SELECT
    department_id,
    AVG(salary) AS avg_salary,
    (SELECT MAX(avg_salary)
     FROM (SELECT AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
           FROM employees
           GROUP BY department_id) AS department_avg_salaries) - AVG(salary) AS salary_gap
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id
ORDER BY salary_gap DESC;

3) Employees working on more than 1 project

insert into employees_projects (project_id, employee_id) values (1,1);


select e.id as employee_id, COUNT(ep.project_id) as project_count from employees e
join employees_projects ep on ep.employee_id = e.id
group by e.id
having project_count > 1;
